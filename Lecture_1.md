* Modelling assumptions:

  Coming up with a model consists of making assumptions on the observations $R_i, i = 1, . . . ,n$ in order to draw statistical conclusions. Here are the assumptions we make:

  1. Each $R_i$ is a random variable.
  2. Each of the r.v. $R_i$ is ____ distributed with parameter $p$.
  3. $R_1, ..., R_n$ are mutually independent.

* Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)

  A collection of random variable $X_1, ...,X_n$ are i.i.d if
